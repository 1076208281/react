This object is responsible for deciding when to re-render the view and how to react to user input. With React, these view-controllers objects are called components. A component knows how to render its view and how to handle to the user’s interaction with it.</p>\n<p>The interesting thing is that React is figuring out by itself when to re-render a view and how to do this in the most efficient way.</p>\n<p><a href="https://blog.mayflower.de/3937-Backbone-React.html">Read the full post…</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id="using-facebooks-react-with-requirejs"><a href="#using-facebooks-react-with-requirejs" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Using facebook’s React with require.js</h2>\n<p><a href="http://blog.xenji.com/">Mario Mueller</a> wrote a menu component in React and was able to easily integrate it with require.js, EventEmitter2 and bower.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I recently stumbled upon facebook’s React library, which is a JavaScript library for building reusable frontend components.

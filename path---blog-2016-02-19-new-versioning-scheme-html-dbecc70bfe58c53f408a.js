By moving to major revisions in the semver scheme, we can release new versions without breaking existing ones.</p>\n<html><head></head><body></body></html>\n<p>That means that if one component needs a new API, there is no need for any of the other components to do any further work.

People have long asked what React v1.0 will look. Technically some breaking changes are important to avoid stagnating, but we still achieve stability by making it easy to upgrade. If major version numbers indicate API stability and engender trust that it can be used in production, then we got there a long time ago. There are too many preconceived notions of what v1.0 is. We’re still following semver. We’re just communicating stability by moving the 0 from the beginning to the end.</p>\n<h2 id="breaking-changes"><a href="#breaking-changes" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Breaking Changes</h2>\n<p>Minor revision releases will include deprecation warnings and tips for how to upgrade an API or pattern that will be removed or changed in the future.</p>\n<p>We will continue to release <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0pOgY8__JM">codemods</a> for common patterns to make automatic upgrades of your codebase easier.</p>\n<p>Once we’ve reached the end of life for a particular major version, we’ll release a new major version where all deprecated APIs have been removed.</p>\n<h2 id="avoiding-the-major-cliff"><a href="#avoiding-the-major-cliff" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Avoiding The Major Cliff</h2>\n<p>If you try to upgrade your component to 16.0.0 you might find that your application no longer works if you still have other dependencies.

If we’re not careful, we can hit a cliff where nobody upgrades. This has happened to many software project ecosystems in the past.</p>\n<p>Therefore, we’re committed to making it easy for most components and libraries built on top of React to be compatible with two major versions at the same time. We will do this by introducing new APIs before completely removing the old ones, thereby avoiding those cliffs.</p>\n<html><head></head><body></body></html>',excerpt:"Today we’re announcing that we’re switching to major revisions for React.
